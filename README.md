# centroFlye

### Version 0.8.3 (initial release)
## Overview
centroFlye is an algorithm for centromere assembly using long error-prone reads.
Currently it supports assembly of a human centromere X.
Here we show how to apply it for the centromere X of the CHM13hTERT human cell line.


## Dependencies

+ C++ 14
+ Python 3.6

### Python packages (preferably latest versions):
+ [Biopython](https://pypi.org/project/biopython/)
+ [Edlib](https://pypi.org/project/edlib/)
+ [Networkx](https://pypi.org/project/networkx/)
+ [Numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
+ [Regex](https://pypi.org/project/regex/)

### External software
+ [Flye](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye) (*v2.5*, tested on commit: `315122d2ff58025aa4c38227239f431490b557ac`)
+ [Noise Cancelling Repeat Finder (NCRF)](https://github.com/makovalab-psu/NoiseCancellingRepeatFinder) (Tested on commit : `758206f1689ad1338cf7a841482dbf12548c337a`)

Please note that all external software by default has to be in your `PATH`.

### Data
+ `<path_to_CHM13>` â€” path where the T2T ONT reads are located (rel2, Guppy flip-flop 2.3.1, can be downloaded from [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/nanopore-human-wgs/chm13/nanopore/rel2/rel2.fastq.gz), also see [github](https://github.com/nanopore-wgs-consortium/CHM13)).

## Availability
Final assembly and all intermediate results of the pipeline described below are published at [ZENODO](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3369553)

## Quick start guide for cenX (centroFlye)

If you want to run the whole centroFlye pipeline with one command, please run
```
./run_all_cenX.sh <path_to_CHM13> results_cenX 50
```
You can customize the output directory and the number of threads:
```
./run_all_cenX.sh <path_to_CHM13> <output directory> <number of threads>
```
All intermediate and final results will then be placed in `<output directory>`.
If you want to start from scratch you can simply remove this directory.

**Required resources**:
+ Storage space: ~150GB (mostly from the first step "Recruitment of centromeric reads", see below)
+ Clock time: ~9 hours (mostly recruitment of unique k-mers)
+ RAM: peak usage up to 800GB


## Pipeline for cenX (centroFlye)
In this manual we go step-by-step demonstrating centroFlye algorithm.
The detailed information about the algorithm can be found in the paper.

Please, run all commands from the root of the repository.
Results of all steps will be stored at `results_cenX` directory.

### 1. Recruitment of centromeric X reads

We use 50x ultra-long Oxford Nanopore dataset generated by [Telomere2Telomere Consorsium](https://github.com/nanopore-wgs-consortium/CHM13). 
This step is run directly on the reads at the [link](https://s3.amazonaws.com/nanopore-human-wgs/chm13/nanopore/rel2/rel2.fastq.gz).
The following bash script splits the input file in 50 files and runs DXZ1-based recruitment in 50 threads.
DXZ1 is supplied in the current repo at ``supplementary_data/DXZ1_rc.fasta``.
The result of this step is a fasta file with centromeric reads that is stored at `results_cenX/centromeric_reads/centromeric_reads.fasta`

From the root of the project run 
```
make -C scripts/read_recruitment
```
and start recruitment (`<path_to_CHM13>` is where the ONT reads are located, see section `Dependencies/Data`):
```
bash scripts/read_recruitment/run_read_recruitment.sh \
       <path_to_CHM13>/rel2.fastq.gz \
       results_cenX/centromeric_reads 50 11100000
```
**Required resources**:
+ Storage space: 150GB
+ Clock time: 1 hour
+ RAM: < 50MB

### 2. Applying centroFlye to centromere X reads
At this step we are utilizing centromeric reads from step 1 and run centroFlye on them.
The result of this step is the final cenX assembly that is stored at `results_cenX/final_assembly.fasta`.
The following command uses 50 threads.

```
python centroFlye.py \
            --reads results_cenX/centromeric_reads/centromeric_reads.fasta \
            -t 50 \
            --outdir results_cenX \
            --unit supplementary_data/DXZ1_rc.fasta
```
**Required resources**:
+ Storage space: < 3GB
+ Clock time: ~9 hours (mostly recruitment of unique k-mers)
+ RAM: peak usage up to 800GB
